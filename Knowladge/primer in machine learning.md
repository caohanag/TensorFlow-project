If I'm building a device that detects if somebody is say walking and I have data about their speed, I might write code like this and if they're running well that's a faster speed so I could adapt my code to this and if they're biking, well that's not too bad either. I can adapt my code like this. But then I have to do golf recognition too, now my concept becomes broken. But not only that, doing it by speed alone of course is quite naive. We walk and run at different speeds uphill and downhill and other people walk and run at different speeds to us.

The new paradigm is that I get lots and lots of examples and then I have labels on those examples and I use the data to say this is what walking looks like, this is what running looks like, this is what biking looks like and yes, even this is what golfing looks like. So, then it becomes answers and data in with rules being inferred by the machine. A machine learning algorithm then figures out the specific patterns in each set of data that determines the distinctiveness of each.
